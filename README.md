# Project for subject TBA4250 (Geografisk informasjonbehandling 2)

The task for the assignment was to make an application, perferrably a web based one, that had some map based functionality. 
The application uses a Postgres-database with the Postgis extension, a Flask backend, and a Typescript/React frontend. 

Unfortunately, the application URL is not currently available, due to the server being down while the subject is not running (TBA4250 is a spring subject). 
It runs on an Apache-server, using WSGI to connet with Flask.
